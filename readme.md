# Troy Gilbert's Blog

Building a very simple blogging engine is just a way to test out some CMS ideas that will eventually apply to `adventure.computer`.

## Structure

* Everything is a page.
* All pages are in folders.
* If a specific page isn't specified the "index" page is assumed.
* All pages are referenced by slug in the public URLs.
* Pages can be referenced by ID directly (not obfuscated, just raw DB ID).
* Pages are formatted in Markdown or HTML.
* Pages can have tags.
* Pages can have comments?
